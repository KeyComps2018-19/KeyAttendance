# 404-repo-name-DNE

To run:
```
export FLASK_APP="main.py"
python3 -m flask run
```
This assumes you've run `pip3 install flask` at some point.

Alternatively, if you don't need the backend (which we don't right now), you can get away with opening `index.html` with a web browser (guarenteed to work on at least Firefox).
